## Testing

It is possible to create test running independently of other tests.

Steps :
1. Create a new test class in the "tests" folder.
2. Use the same structure as in the whiteTriangle.hpp file. setup() and render() functions must be implemented
3. Register the test by including it at the end of the test.hpp file
4. To use the test, specify its class name in the macro TESTCLASS in the file main.hpp
