## Testing

It is possible to create test running independantly of other test.

Steps :
1. Create a new test class in the "tests" folder.
2. Use the same structure as in the whiteTriangle.hpp file. setup() and render() functions must be implemented
3. Register the test by including it at the end of the test.hpp file
4. To use the test, specify its classname in the macro TESTCLASS in the file main.hpp
